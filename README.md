   - We outline features, platforms, estimated delivery time, and cost.
   - You confirm the scope and terms.

3. **Development & Testing**
   - We create the bot/integration on a test environment.
   - We demonstrate the features to you (screenshots, video, or live demo).

4. **Deployment**
   - We deploy to your server, hosting, or cloud environment.
   - Alternatively, we can host some parts and connect to your services.

5. **Handover & Basic Training**
   - We show you how to use commands, change basic settings, and manage the bot.
   - Documentation or simple usage guide can be provided.

6. **Optional: Ongoing Support**

## 8. FAQ

### 8.1 Do I need my own server?

- For some platforms (like Discord/Telegram bots), we recommend having a VPS or cloud instance to host the bot.
- For webhooks and integrations, a server or hosting that can run scripts or an application is usually required.
- If you are not sure, contact us with what you have — we will advise on the best option.

### 8.2 Can you work with existing bots?

Yes. We can review your existing bot or scripts, fix issues, and add new features, depending on code quality and access.

### 8.3 Do you handle security?

We do our best to follow good practices:
- Never hard-code your secrets in public code.
- Use environment variables or configuration files.
- Restrict access via roles/permissions where supported by the platform.

You are encouraged to rotate tokens/passwords after setup for extra security.

### 8.4 How do we start?

Simple:

1. Contact us on **Telegram**, **Email**, or **Discord**.
2. Share your idea and which platform(s) you are targeting.
3. We respond with questions, options, and a quote.
